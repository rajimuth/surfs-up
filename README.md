# surfs-up - Weather Analysis for a potential Surf and shake shop 

## Purpose of the analysis:
This analysis is done to look at the weather data (precipitatiob and temperature) for the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The data will help in deciding if Oahu is an ideal location for this project.


## Initial Analysis:
Initial analysis was done to provide an insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu where the shop can be built. Closer look at the precipitation from the recent dat(past one year) is as below:

This report for all the station observations the recent year shows that some months have higher amounts of precipitation than others. But overall, the precipaition data shows that Oahu is a great location for the new surf shop. The precipitation data was recorded from 9 stations.

But the goal is to identify if the location is best not only for surf shop but also for eating icecream (surf and shake shop). So further analysis was done to look further in to temperature of the location. The temperature data for the recent one year was filtered and plotted.

As seen from the above plot, most of the temperature recorded was above 67 degrees.

## Current Analysis:
The recent analysis was done to get more information on the temperature trends. Further analysis was done for the tempersture data for the months of June abd december to determine if the surf and icecream shop business is year around.
A query was written to filter out the temperature for the month of june and december and made in to a list and further converted to data frame

**JUNE:**

**DECEMBER:**

Statistics from the filtered temperature data for the month of June and December is as shown below:

## Results:
The mean temperature between the months of June and December was not very different.

Mean Temperature was ~74.9 degress for June and 71 Degrees for December.

The maximum temperature recorded was above 80 degrees on both the month.

The temperature statistics for the month of June and december shows that tempearture is favorable for a year around surf and shake shop in Ohau, Hawaai

### Future Analysis:
It will be nice to have data point from another month added as well
Further analysis needs to be done  to look at the precipitation data for those months.
A visualization  of precipitaion and temperature data for the same months can provide us a better picture and validity.
